# Brain_Tumor_Detection
Brain Tumor Detection is an automated method proposed to differentiate between non-healthy and healthy Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans of the brain at an early stage of brain tumor development. The project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a type of Deep Learning algorithm, to analyze MRI images and identify abnormal tissue growth indicative of a brain tumor.

Motivation
Brain tumors can grow rapidly and, if left untreated, can lead to serious health complications and even death. Early detection is crucial for timely treatment and improved patient outcomes. By developing an automated system for brain tumor detection, we aim to facilitate early diagnosis and intervention, potentially saving lives and improving prognosis for patients with brain tumors.

Methodology
The proposed method leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a powerful deep learning technique originally designed for image analysis. CNNs are capable of learning features from MRI images and distinguishing between healthy and non-healthy brain tissue based on patterns and abnormalities detected in the images.

Key Features
Automatic differentiation between healthy and non-healthy MRI scans
Utilization of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image analysis
Early detection of brain tumors to facilitate timely treatment
Improved prognosis and patient outcomes through early intervention
Usage
To use the Brain Tumor Detection system:

Input MRI Images: Provide MRI images of the brain to the system.
Automated Analysis: The system automatically analyzes the images using CNNs.
Detection Result: Receive the result indicating whether the MRI scan shows signs of brain tumor or not.
